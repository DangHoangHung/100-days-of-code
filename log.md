# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2017 Monday
##### (not really begin)

**Today's Progress**: Start watching Bootstrap tutorial video and code along.

**Thoughts:** I can't really remember what is in the video. It is quite difficult to begin but easier to keep going.

### Day 1: January 31, 2017 Tuesday
##### (quite a slacker today)

**Today's Progress**: Keep going with the Bootstap tutorial video. Not much progress.

**Thoughts**: I didn't really get back to FCC even I want to do it so much. Got stuck in a challenge. I shoulf finish the tutorial tomorrow. Not much have been done today.

### Day 2: February 1, 2017 Wednesday
##### (quite productive)

**Today's Progress**: I watched the part about carousel, then the glyphicon. I don't know what happened but carousel didn't work. The tutorial only mentions about how to add symbols of glyphicon into the webpage. Then it briefly show how to use well and how to manipulate the shape of the frame of an image.

**Thoughts**: The tutorial seems to take more time to finish than I had expected. Again I struggle with memorizing the code and how to apply them into the real situation when I have to face with the entire blank page. I know I should upload my code to GitHub but I still don't know how to do that.

### Day 3: February 2, 2017 Thursday
##### (it's ok, I got stucked)

**Today's Progress**: text color and background color can be changed with the same classes with the button that I had learned before. Dropdown has a problem because I couldn't make it work.

**Thoughts**: It makes me angry when my codes do not work. All I do is to follow the tutorial. I even copy the original codes from the author's page to test but it doesn't work either. Maybe I should write a comment to report this problem to him. I will try it again tomorrow along with the carousel.

### Day 4: February 3, 2017 Friday
##### (not much)

**Today's Progress**:input group but still stuck with dropdown

**Thoughts**: First I thought it is because of the ajax but after I add ajax, it is still the same.

### Day 5: February 7, 2017 Tuesday
##### (not much)

**Today's Progress**:Review command lines a little bit, start learning about text editor

### Day 6: February 10, 2017 Tuesday
##### (not much)

**Today's Progress**:Study Vim, know how to start it

### Day 7: February 12, 2017 Tuesday
##### (not much)

**Today's Progress**: Keeping learning the Vim, know how to add info into the file and tossing up with its content

### Day 8: February 13, 2017 Tuesday
##### (little bit)

**Today's Progress**: Finish the first part - learning basic things about Vim

**Thoughts**: I am applying Fayman method. It is quite slow

### Day 9: February 14, 2017 Tuesday
##### (quite slow)

**Today's Progress**: Try to download in install Atom and use terminal to run the file

**Thoughts**: I feel quite strange when I try to learn Atom. A strong feeling that pushes me and makes me quite jumpy. Anyway there is a difference between my operation system (Ubuntu) and the operating system in the tutorial (MacOS). It shows that I should read more to understand how Atom works in this OS. On ther other hand, Atom has quite attractive advantage that I like. However, the dull color can be quite discouraging.

### Day 10: February 15, 2017 Tuesday
##### (super slow)

**Today's Progress**: Get stuck a while with Cloud9, read syntax, Markdown language and move around atom

**Thoughts**: Not much
