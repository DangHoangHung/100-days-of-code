# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2017 
##### (not really begin)

**Today's Progress**: Start watching Bootstrap tutorial video and code along.

**Thoughts:** I can't really remember what is in the video. It is quite difficult to begin but easier to keep going.

### Day 1: January 31, 2017
##### (quiet a slacker today)

**Today's Progress**: Keep going with the Bootstap tutorial video. Not much progress.

**Thoughts**: I didn't really get back to FCC even I want to do it so much. Got stuck in a challenge. I shoulf finish the tutorial tomorrow. Not much have been done today.
