# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2017 Monday
##### (not really begin)

**Today's Progress**: Start watching Bootstrap tutorial video and code along.

**Thoughts:** I can't really remember what is in the video. It is quite difficult to begin but easier to keep going.

### Day 1: January 31, 2017 Tuesday
##### (quite a slacker today)

**Today's Progress**: Keep going with the Bootstap tutorial video. Not much progress.

**Thoughts**: I didn't really get back to FCC even I want to do it so much. Got stuck in a challenge. I shoulf finish the tutorial tomorrow. Not much have been done today.

### Day 2: February 1, 2017 Wednesday
##### (quite productive)

**Today's Progress**: I watched the part about carousel, then the glyphicon. The tutorial only mentions about how to add symbols of glyphicon into the webpage. Then it briefly show how to use well and how to manipulate the visualization of images.

**Thoughts**: The tutorial seems to take more time to finish than I had expected. Again I struggle with memorizing the code and how to apply them into the real situation when I have to face with the entire blank page. I know I should upload my code to GitHub but I still don't know how to do that.
